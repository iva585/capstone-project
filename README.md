## Hamiti - Neue Fische Capstone Project

Hamiti is an app that helps users keep track of their food inventory and recipes.
I am developing it as a capstone project for Neue Fische Bootcamp.

## Installation

To install use:

```
yarn install
```

I have opted for using yarn instead of npm, because of peer dependency issues between Material UI and Emotion.

To run the development server use:

```
npm run client:dev
```

## Tech Stack

- React
- Typescript
- Styled Components
- Material UI
- Storybook
